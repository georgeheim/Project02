Project02

Due: Friday, March 2, at class time. Project demonstrations with be expected during class.

Each team is required to keep a detailed list of activities performed by all team members, in the order 
the activies happen. I expect to see an even distribution of work, and cooperative teams.

Modify the Project base code to use the strategy pattern to add strategies for people.

Each team's leader will fork this repository. Add the instructor, and team members,  as
collaborators of the fork.

Each team will create two Nations (choose names)

Each team will create a tribe for each team member (choose name).

Each team member will create at least a warrior and a wizard. A tribe can have as many members as
desired, without exceeding the tribes lifePoints maximum.

Each team member will create at least one strategy, using the strategy pattern, for each warrior and
wizard. Modify the code to allow for dynamic changing of strategies.

Strategies can be based on:
Nation
Tribe
PeopleType
lifePoints
and other attributes that are visible to a person in their encounterStrategy method.

Positive lifePoints returned from encounterStrategy indicate an attack.
non-positive lifePoints returned from encouterStrategy indicate either the person is running away or
healing the other player.

Each team will create a working version of Warring Nation and be able to demonstrate its exection.

Changes to the encounter method can only be made with the approval of the instructor. If you have a 
suggestion that will improve encounters, or make them more realistic, then let me know.
